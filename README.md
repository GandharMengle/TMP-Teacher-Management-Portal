# Teacher-Management-Portal

<p>
This README will guide along the project - TMP [Teacher Management Program].

The initial ideology is to create an app which will help teachers to perform below tasks:
1. Add or Delete Organization.
2. Count number of teaching hours.
3. Calculate monthly expected payment from each organization

Current Tasks:
1. Splash screen.
2. Login screen. --> Login screen have 2 xml files - one for API 24 to 25 and another for API 26 and above
3. Integration of Firebase authentication.
4. Home screen.

Fixes Needed:
1. Unlock the orientation lock for login activity. --> Currently screen orientation for login activity is locked to Portrait as UI is designed in linear layout thus in landscape the items not scrollable.
